## Approach Taken

After deciding on my project idea I first wanted to wireframe the initial flow of the site and layout what relationships I would need to have. I chose to use both figma and white boarding to complete this task. Then, I did some research to see if I there were any external APIs I could use to  help bring in the information of the products users would add to their closet. Unfortunately when looking into a Barcode API that would return sneaker and clothes information to help pre-populate the fields when a user provides a barcode.
